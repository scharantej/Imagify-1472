## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

**index.html (Homepage):**
- Contains the form for generating the AI-generated image background.
- Includes Bootstrap elements for layout and styling.

**results.html (Results Page):**
- Displays the AI-generated image background.
- Includes Bootstrap elements for user feedback and navigation.

### Routes

**@app.route('/')**
- GET: Renders the homepage with the AI image generation form.

**@app.route('/generate-image', methods=['POST'])**
- POST: Receives the product data from the homepage form.
- Calls the AI model to generate the image background.
- Redirects to the results page with the generated image.

**@app.route('/results', methods=['GET'])**
- GET: Renders the results page with the AI-generated image background.
- Includes options for downloading, sharing, or regenerating the image.

### Additional Notes

- The application will require a Flask-based API for interacting with the AI model for image generation.
- The AI model and API integration details fall outside the scope of the Flask application design.
